# FelzenszwalbNetworkx
A networkx implementation of the Felzenszwalb algorithm

We implemented the greedy, graph-based image segmentation by Felzenszwalb et al. The paper and other results can be found here: http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/.

Note that this implementation is slow, as we did not use the disjoint-set data structure as described in the paper. 

Pull-requests to do so are generally accepted/recommended.
